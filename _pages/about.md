I am a [PhD student in physics at Princeton University](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/zachary-atkins), advised by [Jo Dunkley](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/jo-dunkley). I analyze data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to learn more about fundamental physics. I am a member of the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://act.princeton.edu/) (ACT) and the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/) (SO) collaborations. ACT and SO are making exceptionally low-noise and high-resolution maps of 40% of the microwave sky, including the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, from atop [Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert, Chile](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5pNMJK6Q4B25bVde6). 


During my PhD, I developed core components of the ACT data release 6 (DR6) cosmology pipeline. My work has enabled [measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05202) of [CMB lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05203) by [large-scale-structure at "low" redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05659), [measurements of the gas content in and around massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01258), and a measurement of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum*. I also helped develop Jupyter notebook-based curricula for [ACT DR4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03154), [DR5](https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR4_DR5_Notebooks), and [DR6](https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR6_Notebooks), and co-taught these materials in multiple ["data schools"](https://sites.google.com/uchicago.edu/act-sptcmbanalysissummersc) for junior members of the cosmology research community.

My contributions and research interests include:

* [map-level noise modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04180) for all ACT DR6 analyses
* covariance modeling and systematics tests for the ACT DR6 power spectrum*
* map-level inference for small scales (CMB, dust, ...)*
* making all of the above [accessible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03154) and [easy-to-use](https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR4_DR5_Notebooks) to [researchers](https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR6_Notebooks) and the [public](https://sites.google.com/uchicago.edu/act-sptcmbanalysissummersc)

I look forward to continuing this work for SO!

I obtained my undergraduate degree in physics from Princeton University in 2016. I then worked for two years as a foreign exchange (FX) derivatives analyst at Barclays. I returned to physics by helping kickstart [in-lab detector testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11301) for the [SO focal plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01458) under [Suzanne Staggs](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/suzanne-t-staggs) (through 2020). I love baseball, the Philadelphia food scene, and napping with [my cats](/cats/). 

*coming soon!
